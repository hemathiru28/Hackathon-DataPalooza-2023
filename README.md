Hackathon : DataPalooza - Connecting Insights with Twilio Segment and Databricks powered by AWS

My contribution: 
My primary responsibility involved setting up Databricks on AWS to generate synthetic data for reverse ETL. Leveraging Databricks, I developed a Python script using PySpark to generate a substantial volume of synthetic data that closely mirrored the events typically generated in the mobile app environment.
I integrated Databricks with Google Sheets and Mixpanel through Twilio Segment. This integration allowed for seamless data transfer and testing of the pipelines we established with Twilio Segment.![image](https://github.com/hemathiru28/PortfolioProjects/assets/38637852/06e4353b-357d-4442-8bc4-52120bb7b7be)
